    <p>
      I'm a self-taught developer making the jump into tech after 3 years of
      dedicated learning. My path started with a simple console.log("Hello
      World") through The Odin Project - once I saw I could make a computer
      respond to what I'd typed, I was completely hooked.

      Coming from a background as an ESRI/ARCFM technician, I've always been
      someone who likes to dig into how things are made - whether that's music
      gear, film processes, or now web apps. What drew me to frontend initially
      was the immediate visual feedback loop, but I'm naturally progressing
      toward full-stack work and currently diving into PHP with plans to learn
      Laravel.

      My learning approach is methodical - when React wasn't clicking, I stepped
      back to solidify my JavaScript foundations. I spent 4 months with Python
      and OOP concepts, which made certain JS concepts much clearer. Every
      project I build has a specific learning goal, whether that's data
      fetching, state management, or styling techniques.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm looking for a role that balances autonomy with mentorship - I learn
      well in sink-or-swim situations but also want to absorb best practices
      from experienced developers. Longer term, I'm excited about the prospect
      of mentoring others myself; helping people understand complex concepts is
      one of the most satisfying parts of any role I've had.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently job hunting after redundancy, I'm open to relocating for the
      right opportunity and hoping to land something this year. What excites me
      most is the constant learning and the possibility of building something
      people actually use and benefit from.
